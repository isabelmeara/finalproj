This is the Final Project for Syracuse Newhouse JNL 221. 


The project was to find data on the Internet, turn it into data visualizations, and write a story about the findings, including a live source, and then format the article into an HTML/CSS file. 

The concept for mine was analyzing the economic and educational disparities of single mothers in this country, specifically through the lens of a single mother that recently went viral on Tiktok for her vlogs about her twin girls. I interviewed a single mother to better understand the inner difficulties of the role, and the difficulties she faced pursuing further education. The whole article and visualizations is in the HTML/ CSS files and you can see the original data on the data files and data explanations. 


PLEASE ENJOY! I am so proud of this and excited to share.

Thank you for an amazing semester Professor Richards!
